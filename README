|- COMPILING -|
The provided Makefile will build the two executables "oss" and
    "osschild"
Simply run "make" and the two  executables will be outputted.
    See the USAGE section below to see how to run the programs.
A cleaning function is provided. run "make clean" to clean up
	the directory and leave only src behind.


|- USAGE -|
The "oss" executable is intended to simulate process scheduling
    for an operating system. 

The oss executable takes 2 required arguments:
[-s n] Specifies the time in seconds you wish for the oss simulator
    to run.
[-l logfile] Specifies the output file to which log messages will be
    written.
-h Shows a help menu.


The osschild excutable is run by oss. It is not intended to be run alone.
    However, it takes two arguments from oss. This being the following:
[-p pid] The simulated pid of the process
[-m mode] Wether it is running in simulated IO mode or CPU mode


|- FUNCTIONALITY -|
The oss executable will generate a number of children processes. And add
them to a queue. The children process will signal the oss over a message queue
when they are ready to execute. 

Oss will select a process from the process queue and give it some time to
execute. 


|- KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS -|
